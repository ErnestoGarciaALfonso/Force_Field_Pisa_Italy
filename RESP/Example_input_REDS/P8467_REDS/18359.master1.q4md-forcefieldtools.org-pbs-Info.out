 Case-insensitive check: './Mol_red1-1.log' found: './Mol_red1-1.log' already in the working directory

 Check the presence of the Data-R.E.D.Server directory in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No Data-R.E.D.Server directory found

 The conformations in a PDB input file must have the same atom order
 The conformations in the QM files must have the same atom order
 The atom order in the PDB and QM files must be identical

 → PDB input file: ./Mol_red1.pdb
 Copy ./Mol_red1.pdb into ./Mol_red1.pdb-ArchiveFile
 Check the format and the ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, ENDMDL, TER & CONECT keywords of Mol_red1.pdb
 Modify this file according to the PDB file format, and set the LF Unix ending character
 The number of atoms of Mol_red1.pdb is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok
 Check the number of atoms for the 1 conformation(s) of Mol_red1.pdb
 Mol_red1.pdb - Conformation No = 1 - Atoms per conformation = 3
 • Check the Mol_red1.pdb PDB input file:
   Single Conformation: no Atom Order to compare; Check the Elements
 ◦  Elements & Atom order OK
 • Check the QM file(s):
   QM file = Mol_red1-1.log - GAUSSIAN QM file detected - Conf. no 1
   GAUSSIAN 'Geom. optimization' file detected
   Check: Mol_red1-1.log is a valid QM file
   Single Conformation: no Atom Order to compare; Check the Elements
 ◦  Elements & Atom order OK
   Compare the Atom Order in PDB inputs vs QM files:
 ◦  Atom order OK

 Check the total charge/spin multiplicity values in the Project.config, PDB input and QM geometry optimization files:
 - Mol_red1.pdb: Case 1 0 - MTtChg1 -1 MTtChg2 0 Sum 0 - Conf 1
 -- MTtChg1 is known and MTtChg2 is undef. - use the value already present in the Project.config file
 -- 1 1 - GAUSSIAN QM geometry optimization Mol_red1-1.log file found
 --- Mol_red1-1.log: MTtChg3 = 0 and MSMutp3 = 1
 ---- Single MTtChg3 value - Single MSMutp3 value - Single conf.: no comparison: OK
 ----- MTtChg3 != MTtChg1 AND MSMutp3 != MSMutp1: NOT OK
       Consider MTtChg1/MSMutp1 not correct for molecule 1: let's transfert the QM values in the Project.config file

 List the PDB input file(s) found in the working directory:
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 Check and/or correct the indexes of the atoms of Mol_red1.pdb
 1 consecutive Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB input file(s) found in the working directory

 The Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB file number & consecutive PDB input file number are identical:
   The Mol_red1.pdb file is the only PDB input file used in this job

 The number of atoms of the Mol_red1.pdb input file is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok

 CHECK AND CORRECT THE KEYWORDS IN THE 'Project.config' AND 'System.config' FILES:
 • 'System.config' file found in the working directory:
 Remove empty lines and special characters, set the LF ending character, homogenize the comments, and format the file
 • 'Project.config' file found in the working directory:
 Remove empty lines and special characters, set the LF ending character, homogenize the comments, and format the file

 Add keywords chosen by the user during the submission procedure or defined by the PBS script in the System.config file

 ANALYSIS OF THE 'System.config' FILE USED FOR THIS JOB:
 Charge derivation procedure  = RESP-P1
 OPT_Calc = OFF: the geometry optimization step is not requested
 Default option: Freq_Calc = OFF - The frequencies computation step is not requested
   (This step is useful to determine the nature of the stationary point found during the geometry optimization step)
 Default option: MEPCHR_Calc = ON - The MEP computation and charge derivation/force field generation steps are carried out
 Default option: Re_Fit = OFF - The re-generation of the force field from QM data is not requested

 OPT_Calc = OFF is defined in the System.config file
 Correct PDB input & QM files found with compatible atom orders
 Let's execute PyRED...
