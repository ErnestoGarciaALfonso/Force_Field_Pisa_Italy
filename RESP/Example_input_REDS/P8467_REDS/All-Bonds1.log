 The listed bond values below can be used in different contexts:
 - To determine the 'Dist0(ang)' equilibrium values of the BOND FF parameters
   for the missing FF parameters reported in the 'frcmod.unknown' file
   For this purpose it is advised to use DFT with a large basis set to compute
   accurate values.
 - To validate the FF generated by PyRED: the listed values can be compared to
   values observed during MD simulation.
 FF: force field; MD: molecular dynamics; DFT: density functional theory.
 Data are sorted by bond values and by atom types
