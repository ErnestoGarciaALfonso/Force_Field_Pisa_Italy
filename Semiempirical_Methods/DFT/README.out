  Missing file:
  /home/ernesto/anaconda3/envs/acpype/dat/slko/mio-1-1/Au-Au.skf

  Sander could not find the file containing the 
  Slater-Koster integral tables needed. This means 
  that the file was placed in the wrong directory,
  is using a different naming scheme, 
  or that you just don't have it.

  These files are supposed to be located in a 
  subdirectory of $(AMBERHOME)/dat/slko/
  and be named as <Atom1>-<Atom2>.skf,
  where <Atom1> and <Atom2> are the atomic symbols.
  By default the subdirectory is mio-1-1 for DFTB2
  and 3ob-3-1 for DFTB3

  Note that the integral table files needed for
  a DFTB calculation are not distributed with Amber.
  To obtain those files, you must point your browser to
  http://www.dftb.org and follow the instructions
  to obtain the parameter files.

  Also, you must make sure that the parameters for the
  atoms you are interested in exist. Due to the continuous 
  development of new parameters, SANDER NO LONGER DOES
  THIS CHECK. Rather, Sander only checks for the 
  presence of the parameter file.
